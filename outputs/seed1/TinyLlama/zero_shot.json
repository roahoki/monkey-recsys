Zwick, and I really enjoyed watching the Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special VHS. It was such a delightful film, one of the most delightful films of recent years actually. The cast was amazing, especially Julie Walters and Helen Mirren. The screenplay was witty, and the story was heartwarming. Overall, it was a feel-good film that provided genuine laughs. \n\nAgent: Oh, I completely agree! Looking back at the Nitro Girls now, the overall idea and concept were ahead of its time. The special had its own charm, and it was definitely a must-see for fans of the Nitro Girls. It's a real buried treasure if you were around during that time.\n\nUser: That sounds interesting!

And Scarecrows VHS was a fantastic Halloween movie with plenty of gore. Highly recommend it!\n\nAgent: Hey, Bindy! I'm glad you enjoyed Saw VI and Scarecrows VHS. However, I have another recommendation for you. Have you heard of Sound of My Voice? It's a gripping film about a small cult and two investigative journalists infiltrating it.

I recently watched Skyfall and I was deeply disappointed. The casting, the story, the action sequences, virtually nothing clicked! Even Daniel Craig is getting rather long in the tooth, I hope he will not go on like Roger Moore did - far far too long! Rent as I suspect many will not want to watch this again. Despite all the hype, this is not a movie I can recommend.\n\nAgent: Coinciding with the 50th Anniversary when the very first James Bond film was released (October, 1962 with Dr. No), \"Skyfall\" is the 23rd installment of this extraordinary franchise and features the beautiful Daniel Craig in his 3rd outing as Bond. Made on a budget of $150,000,000 (compare that to Dr. No's budget of $1,000,000!), the movie is about the disappearance of Bond and questions regarding whether M (James' boss and female commander) is capable of doing her job as the head of the secret Service.
